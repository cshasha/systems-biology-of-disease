# Systems Biology of Disease

Course material and projects done for the Systems Biology of Disease course at the Institute for Systems Biology. Topics covered include patient stratification (unsupervised machine learning, clustering), patient classification and biomarker discovery (supervised machine learning, miRNA expression data), cellular heterogeneity in disease (single-cell RNA-Seq data), and gene regulatory network inference (multi-omics integration). All work was done using R Bioconductor.
